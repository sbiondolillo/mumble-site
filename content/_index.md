# Welcome to the Voice Server

This page is the **public landing site** for our private Mumble service.  
The actual voice server is only reachable **inside the VPN**.

If you arrived here in a browser, that’s expected — this hostname shows this page unless you connect through the VPN using the Mumble app.

## How to Join

1. **Request access** from a CRM admin  
2. Install the VPN app on your device  
3. Import the configuration file we provide  
4. Activate the VPN tunnel  
5. In the Mumble app, connect to: **mumble.capitalmesh.net**

Once your VPN tunnel is active, this hostname will resolve to the private voice server instead of this page.

## Why We Use a VPN

- Keeps the voice server private  
- Prevents abuse and unauthorized access  
- Ensures low‑latency, encrypted communication  
- Maintains a trusted community environment  

## Need Help?

If you’re having trouble connecting, reach out to a CRM admin for assistance.
